## DevSecOps Pipeline for Terraform Infrastructure Using Trivy in GitHub Actions
This project demonstrates a secure, automated approach to cloud infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and GitHub Actions. It provisions a private AWS S3 bucket using infrastructure-as-code principles and integrates Trivy to scan for security misconfigurations directly within the CI/CD pipeline. Each time code is pushed to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow runs a Trivy scan on the Terraform files and prints the results in a clear table format in the pipeline logs. This setup ensures early detection of potential security issues without requiring external tools or manual reviews, supporting a DevSecOps workflow focused on speed, safety, and simplicity.
